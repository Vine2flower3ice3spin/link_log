#System Locations

If you have installed a Vulkan driver from a GPU vendor, you may wish to verify there is a JSON file installed in one of the following locations:
Directory 	Description
/etc/vulkan/icd.d/ or /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d 	Vulkan driver JSON manifest file, which is not modified by the SDK installer.

Refer to the Vulkan Loader guide, Linux section, for detailed information on ICD and layer library search paths and order for this platform.


#Verify the SDK Installation

Verify the installation of the Vulkan SDK by running:

    Vulkan Installation Analyzer (VIA) with the command:

~$ vkvia

    Vulkan Info with the command:

`~$ vulkaninfo

    Vulkan Cube with the command:

`~$ vkcube


#Vulkan SDK Layers list

The Vulkan SDK includes the following layers:
Layer Name 	Description
VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation 	Vulkan API validation and error checking
VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct 	Capturing application Vulkan commands for GFXReconstruct
VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump 	Print API calls and their parameters and values
VK_LAYER_LUNARG_device_simulation 	Allows modification of an actual device's reported features, limits, and capabilities
VK_LAYER_LUNARG_monitor 	Outputs the frames-per-second of the target application in the applications title bar
VK_LAYER_LUNARG_screenshot 	Outputs specified frames to an image file as they are presented
VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_synchronization2 	Implements the VK_KHR_synchronization2 extension, for use on systems without a driver that implements it.


#VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS environment variable

The Vulkan Layers can be enabled by setting the VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS environment variable to a colon-separated list of layer names, as found in the Vulkan SDK Layers list or within the manifest files.

$ export VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation:VK_LAYER_LUNARG_gfxreconstruct
