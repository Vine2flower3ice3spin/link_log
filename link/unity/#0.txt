####Install the Unity Hub on Linux

###Debian or Ubuntu

To install the Unity Hub on a Debian or Ubuntu Linux distribution, you need to add the Unity Hub Debian repository along with the public signing key to verify the integrity of the packages.

    1.To add the public signing key, run the following command:
        $ wget -qO - https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/keys/public | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg > /dev/null

    2.To add the Unity Hub repository, you need an entry in /etc/apt/sources.list.d. Run the following command to add the Unity Hub repository:
        $ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg] https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/deb stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unityhub.list'

    3.Update the package cache and install the package:
        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt-get install unityhub

**Note: For some systems, you may need to ensure the following:

    The directory /usr/share/keyrings exists.
    The user or group installing the Hub has write permissions to the /usr/share/keyrings directory.
    The user or group installing Hub has at least read permissions to the resulting file Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg.**

    To remove the Unity Hub from the system, run the following command:
        $ sudo apt-get remove unityhub

###Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS

To install the Unity Hub on a RHEL or CentOS Linux distribution, you need to add the Unity Hub rpm repository to your known repositories list.

    1.To add the Unity Hub repository, you need an entry in /etc/yum.repos.d/. Run the following command to add the Unity Hub repository:
        $ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[unityhub]\nname=Unity Hub\nbaseurl=https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/rpm/stable\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/rpm/stable/repodata/repomd.xml.key\nrepo_gpgcheck=1" > /etc/yum.repos.d/unityhub.repo'

    2.Update the package cache and install the package using:
        $ sudo yum check-update
        $ sudo yum install unityhub

To remove the Unity Hub from your system, run the following command:
    $ sudo yum remove unityhub

####Install the beta versions of the Unity Hub on Linux
###Debian or Ubuntu
Unity distributes the Unity Hub beta versions for Linux through the same repository but under a different distribution.

Before you begin, make sure you have added the public signing key already in your keychain (as explained above).

    1.To install the beta version, you need to add another repository entry in your /etc/apt/sources.list:
        $ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/Unity_Technologies_ApS.gpg] https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/deb unstable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/unityhub-beta.list'

    2.Update the package cache and install the package:
        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt-get install unityhub=<version>
Where <version> follows the format of 3.4.1-beta.1.

Note: Only Unity Hub version 3 and higher are distributed through this mechanism.

###Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS

Unity distributes the Unity Hub beta versions for Linux through a different repository. You need to add the repository entry in your package manager.

To add the Unity Hub repository, you need an entry in /etc/yum.repos.d/

    1.Run the following command to add the Unity Hub repository:
        $ sudo sh -c 'echo -e "[unityhub-beta]\nname=Unity Hub Beta\nbaseurl=https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/rpm/unstable\nenabled=1\ngpgcheck=1\ngpgkey=https://hub.unity3d.com/linux/repos/rpm/unstable/repodata/repomd.xml.key\nrepo_gpgcheck=1" > /etc/yum.repos.d/unityhub_beta.repo'

    2.Update the package cache and install the package:
        $ sudo yum check-update
        $ sudo yum install unityhub
